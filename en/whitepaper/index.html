It is a smart contract registered on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20 standard) that guarantees full transparency, traceability and the effective neutralization of greenhouse gas emissions.

<br><br>
It is a digital asset based on carbon credits from carbon sequestration in conservation and forest preservation projects in the Amazon in a jurisdictional context (J-REDD+) that is registered with IHS Markit, one of the largest certifiers of carbon credits. in the world - based in Germany.

In recent decades, the State of Acre has developed efforts to implement a jurisdictional system for emission reductions, based on a robust legal framework with the Law of the State System of Incentives to Environmental Services - SISA, Law 2.308/2010, which establishes a system of promotion and encouragement of environmental services, with a regulatory governance structure, supervision, monitoring, reporting and verification added to the registration and transparency of environmental assets.
<br><br>
In this context, a reference "standard" called ACS - Acre Carbon Standard was created, which served over the years as a foundation for raising financial resources and effective payment for emission reductions with accredited international institutions such as KFW - German Development Bank - with its “Early Movers” REDD Program, which has already accounted for more than 20 million tons removed from the market, having the referred standard been created by the Scientific Committee composed of scientists and renowned internationally recognized professionals, being registered with IHS Markit, in the link:

<br><br>
What is CDSA/SA
<br><br>
CDSA/SA – Companhia de Serviços Ambientais – is responsible for promoting sustainable development and linking itself to voluntary regional and sectoral systems, which allow promoting and increasing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging a low carbon economy. , exploring opportunities related to economic development, social well-being and ecosystem balance, as well as managing and disposing, to the extent of its competence, the assets and credits resulting from ecosystem services and products arising from programs, subprograms, plans and projects, all pursuant to art. 15, items I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII of Law 2,308/10.
<br><br>
CDSA/SA has an institutional and legal governance structure, designed to seek strength and comfort for donors, financiers and investors in the context of promoting and investing in actions aimed at reducing emissions and developing a sustainable and low-carbon economy, in order to comply with the provisions of art. 39, items I, II, III and §1 and 2 of State Law n. 2,308/2010.
<br><br>
What is ACS Token
<br><br>
The Acre Carbon Standard Token (ACS Token) is a token registered on the Ethereum blockchain by Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Serviços Ambientais (CDSA) of the state of Acre in Brazil. It is a digital asset backed by carbon credits from carbon sequestration in forestry projects in a jurisdictional context (J-REDD+) issued and certified by IHS Markit.
<br><br>
The ACS Token was born as a modernization of the SISA project, after twelve years of existence and success. good practices for offsetting environmental impacts, through a Token that allows recording, verifying and issuing, transferring and retiring emission reduction credits from REDD+ projects within the scope of the SISA Law, creating an environment of transparency, credibility, traceability and interoperability for SISA, as defined in art. 3rd item XXI of Law 2.308/10.
<br><br>
Each unit of the ACS Token is equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide (1 tCO2e), which was sequestered through government programs to reduce deforestation and conserve forest areas in the state of Acre (SISA Law).
<br><br>
The ACS Token is a 'smart contract' (ERC-20) on the Ethereum blockchain [address of the smartcontract], which guarantees full transparency, traceability and effective carbon neutralization through the 'burning (retirement)' of the tokens.

<br><br>
In May 2022, in honor of Biodiversity Day, we launched the ACS Token with 5,422,044 tokens available for acquisition and clearing.


<br><br> <br><br>

Where the resources obtained with the ACS Token go
<br><br>
The funds obtained from the ACS Token negotiations will be used for the maintenance, conservation and expansion of the SISA program, which has the following objectives in its strategic planning:
<br><br>
Develop a tokenization program and implement a commercial strategy to democratize and speed up access to environmental credits and the practice of compensation by any person or company, in any amount. As well as improving cash flow for investments in improving SISA.
Develop a costing program for the implementation of public policies that encourage the emergence of a low carbon economy in Acre. Including subsidy for conversation and preservation programs.
Develop, through technological solutions, a payment program for environmental services directly to indigenous peoples, extractive communities, small and medium rural producers..
What are carbon credits?
<br><br>
The Carbon Credit, or Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) is a certificate issued by an individual, legal or governmental person, which reduced its emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the development of this mechanism was born in 1997, from the Kyoto protocol.

<br><br>

One of the mechanisms is the adoption of a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Another mechanism is REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation; in Portuguese, "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation") was a mechanism to encourage forest conservation, reducing degradation and deforestation. As of COP-26, the creation of the J-REED (jurisdictional REDD+) was debated, that is, projects that are under the jurisdiction of government entities.
<br><br>
In the case of the ACS Token, our carbon credits are credits arising from the program of the State System of Incentives to Environmental Services - SISA, Law 2,308/2010, focused on reducing deforestation in the state of Acre, thus being a J-REDD+ program. This program was financed by KFW – German Development Bank – with its REDD Program “Early Movers”, and already accounts for more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide offset.
<br><br>
The Carbon Credit is a unit of measurement that has a ratio of 1 credit equals 1 ton of CO2 removed in a given year. All credits are audited by international institutions, registered on the platforms of these organizations following strict protocols. The ACS Token adds a layer of traceability through Blockchain technology that records the transfers of credits, as well as ensures that there is no double counting of the retirement (compensation) of the ACS Token happens only once (by using the “Burn” function). of the Smart Contract).
<br><br>
About the market
<br><br>
The carbon market emerged from ECO-92, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Brazil was the first country to adhere to this treaty, which established that the 150 signatory countries should limit or reduce their emissions of polluting gases.
<br><br>
Thus, reducing emissions started to generate economic value for countries. It was in this convention that it was established that a ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) corresponds to a carbon credit, which can be traded on the international market. Subsequently, in 2007, the Kyoto Protocol consolidated the rules and methodologies and in the Paris Agreement, in 2015, the carbon market gained more strength, as the signatory nations decided to act together to combat global warming, with the establishment of ambitious targets. . Currently, 194 countries have signed the agreements. In Brazil, it is estimated that the value of the carbon market will be between 13 to 48 billion dollars by 2030, especially in REED projects.
<br><br>
The creation of carbon markets aims to allow people or organizations to neutralize or offset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits, generated by GHG sequestration projects, whether under Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) or REED+ .
<br><br>
Currently, one of the challenges in this market was to make the connection between the credit generators, the verification and control entities and a person or small company that wanted to offset a small volume of emissions. The ACS Token was created exactly to be this technological platform that will guarantee traceability and reliability in this process.
<br><br>
Climate changes
<br><br>
All human activities have some impact on the environment. However, from the 18th century onwards, the Industrial Revolution that took place based on fossil fuels (coal and oil), GHG emissions increased exponentially, to the point that at the end of the 20th century, it was scientifically verified that climate patterns were being modified. as a result of the accumulation of these GHGs in the atmosphere. There were also other impacts such as the increase in industrial activities, unsustainable land use, dumping of pollutants into rivers, lakes and seas, deforestation, among other impacts.
<br><br>
In addition to these impacts, the entire structure of human society will be heavily impacted by climate change, such as:
<br><br>
The rise in sea level due to the melting of the poles, causing the inundation of coastal cities and the subsequent mass migration of these populations;
The desertification of arable areas with the reduction of food supply;
Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, storms, or prolonged droughts;
Among countless others.
Therefore, the democratization of access to compensation mechanisms and the establishment of a robust payment structure for environmental services has become an urgent action for all.
<br><br>
Therefore, ACS Token was born with this purpose: Democratizing access to compensation mechanisms and enabling a robust payment program for environmental services for residents of the State of Acre.
<br><br>
ACS Token certification
<br><br>
Based on the legal and regulatory framework created by the SISA Law, and on the reference standard called ACS – Acre Carbon Standard, which served over the years as a foundation for raising financial resources and effectively paying for emission reductions with accredited international institutions such as such as KFW – German Development Bank – with its REDD Program “Early Movers” which has already accounted for more than 20 million tons removed from the market, with the referred standard having been created by the Scientific Committee composed of scientists and renowned internationally recognized knowledge professionals, being registered with IHS Markit, at the link: https://mer.markit.com/br-reg/public/project.jsp?project_id=103000000005599
